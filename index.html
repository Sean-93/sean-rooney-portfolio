              My current career path started when I got a job at a major web hosting company.  I spent over a year there, and learned the ins and outs of how hosting websites works- I learned how to use Wordpress as well as how to use and navigate Cpanel, MySQL, and File Manager, as well as how to troubleshoot various email and spam issues that customers would have.  I helped countless people in that position by fixing SSL security issues and bringing their websites back from a various array of administrative issues including Wordpress and DNS management.  I would also advise customers on their next step towards successfully and self-sufficiently maintaining their sites and hosting accounts.  I learned a lot there, but I realized that there is so much more technical knowledge to learn, so I decided to take a Full-Stack web development course to greatly enhance my technical knowledge.  In this course, we cover all the necessary elements of front and back-end development includng HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, React, MySQL, and more.  I am very glad to be there, and to have learned so much already.  With this course, I feel like I can really grasp my future in my hands, and have been provided the tools needed to continue helping people in the digital world.
